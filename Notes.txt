Encapsulation
is the act of enclosing something, sa if it were in a capsule. It means thinking carefully about the behaviors your classes 
need and then hiding the details of how they perform those behaviors even making it so other code cannot see or manipulate these details.

public class Account
{
    private List<int> _transactions = new List<int>(); 

    public void Deposit(int amount)
    {
        _transactions.Add(amount);
    }
}

Private will keep it hidden from other pats of the Program
Public makes it available to other parts of the Program

Good rule is to restrict acccess to class members as much as possible

As a general rule, attributes (or member variables) should be made private. 
Instead, the other parts of the program should ask the class to perform tasks related to that information through public methods.

public class Person
{
    private string _title;
    private string _firstName;
    private string _lastName;

    ...
}

Many methods (or member functions) of a class are public. This is the interface that other parts of the program can use to perform the tasks they need.

Are there ever private methods? Yes! Often, a public method will have internal steps or computations to perform to help it do its job.
These "helper functions" are often private, because the only code that needs to access them is in the class.

Example:
public class Person
{
    private string _title;
    private string _firstName;
    private string _lastName;

    public string GetInformalSignature()
    {
        return "Thanks, " + _firstName;
    }

    public string GetFormalSignature()
    {
        return "Sincerely, " + GetFullName();
    }

    private string GetFullName()
    {
        return _title + " " + _firstName + " " + _lastName;
    }
    ...
}

Getters and Setters:
Someitmes you may feel that other parts of the program need access to a member variable. If this is the case,
instead of making the variable public, you should create a meathod to get and set the value.
This ensures that the class still controls access to the evariables and that the variables themselves are hidden

public class Person
{
    private string _title;
    private string _firstName;
    private string _lastName;

    public string GetFirstName()
    {
        return _firstName;
    }

    public void SetFirstName(string firstName)
    {
        _firstName = firstName;
    }

    ...
}

Person p = new Person();
p.SetFirstName("Peter");

Console.WriteLine(p.GetFirstName());
